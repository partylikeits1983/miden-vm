/// asks the Prover for the openings of the mult-linear oracles at `(r_0, ... ,r_{\nu - 1})` i.e.,
/// `v_i = f_i(r_0, ... ,r_{\nu - 1})`. The Verifier then evaluates `g(v_0, ... , v_{\nu - 1})` and

/// At this point, for the Verifier to accept the proof, it needs to check that indeed
/// `v_i = f_i(r_0, ... ,r_{\nu - 1})`, this is the exact content of [`FinalOpeningClaim`], which
/// can be either answered by a direct query to the oracles (i.e., in the compiled protocol this
/// would be answered with an opening proof against the commitment) or through further interaction
/// (as in the case of the GKR protocol).
///
/// The purpose of [`CompositionPolyQueryBuilder`] is to abstract the logic for evaluating the
/// multi-linear polynomials that the Verifier can do by herself. For example, this is the case
/// for periodic columns where given `(r_0, ... ,r_{\nu - 1})` the Verifier can evaluate
/// it at `(r_0, ... ,r_{\nu - 1})` unassisted.
