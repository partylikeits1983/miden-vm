| accumulate_for_odd_index | Given ω, accumulator ν and τ on stack top, this routine first computes ⍳ = ω / (τ - ω), and<br />then accumulates ⍳ into ν, while consuming <a2, a3> only when j is odd \| j ∈ [0..64), following<br />formula for computing β.<br /><br />Where:<br /><a2, a3> which was loaded (during the previous iteration i.e. when j was even) from q_ptr<br />is consumed into ν.<br /><br />Input: [ω, a3, a2, ν1, ν0, τ1, τ0, q_ptr, ...]<br />Output: [ν1', ν0', τ1, τ0, q_ptr, ...]<br /><br />Cycles: 30<br /> |

| verify_remainder_64 | Given memory address of the remainder codeword with 64 evaluations, this routine checks<br />probabilistically that this codeword is the evaluation of a degree 7 polynomial.<br /><br />A few assumptions about q_ptr:<br />- q_ptr is an absolute memory address of the beginning of remainder codeword.<br />- Each evaluation is 2 elements wide because they belong to quadratic extension field (meaning<br />each memory address will hold two consecutive evaluations)<br />- Words (four field elements), in memory, are laid out in this order (a0_0, a0_1, a1_0, a1_1).<br />This means that (a0_1, a0_0) -> first evaluation and (a1_1, a1_0) -> next evaluation<br />- Next 31 memory addresses should be holding remaining 62 evaluations. That is, if q_ptr holds<br />(a0_0, a0_1, a1_0, a1_1), then q_ptr + 1, must hold (a2_0, a2_1, a3_0, a3_1), and q_ptr + 31<br />should be holding (a62_0, a62_1, a63_0, a63_1).<br />- The polynomial is laid out starting from memory address q_ptr + 32 and occupies 4 contiguous<br />memory addresses.<br />If remainder verification fails, execution of the program stops.<br /><br />Input: [τ1, τ0, q_ptr, ...]<br />Output: [...]<br /><br />Cycles: 2931<br /> |
